This is my recuritment task where I was supposed to create a form for adding new dish with POST request.
This app is built using Next.js - a React framework that allows you to build web apps with server-side rendering, additional performance optimization, routing, and more.

## Node and npm

Node.js v18.16.0

npm v.9.5.1

## Getting Started
First download project:

-  Download project with command ```git clone https://github.com/PanKarton/NewDishForm.git```
- Get to the project folder ```cd NewDishForm``` 


Then, install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then run project on developer mode

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Or build it and start it on production mode (optimized build, so it's quick as light)

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
# or
yarn run build
yarn run start
# or
ppnpm run build
pnpm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
