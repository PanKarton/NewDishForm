This is my recuritment task where I was supposed to create a form for adding new dish with POST request.

## Node and npm

Node.js v18.16.0

npm v.9.5.1

## Getting Started

First, install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then run project on developer mode

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Or build it and start it on production mode (optimized build, so it's quick as light)

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
# or
yarn run build
yarn run start
# or
ppnpm run build
pnpm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
